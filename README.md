Fintech Finder is an innovative platform designed to help you find, hire, and pay fintech professionals. As the lead developer, we have integrated the Ethereum blockchain network into our application to enable you to make cryptocurrency payments to the fintech professionals you hire. This README will guide you through the process of using our Ethereum integration to pay your chosen fintech professional seamlessly.

Your tasks include:

Generating a new Ethereum account instance using a provided mnemonic seed phrase from Ganache.
Fetching and displaying your Ethereum account balance.
Calculating the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including gas estimates, to pay a Fintech Finder candidate.
Digitally signing a transaction to pay a Fintech Finder candidate and sending it to the Ganache blockchain.
